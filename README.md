This game doesn't use any external libraries. It is built only using Vanilla Js to learn the language better. 
The idea is that if the basics of the language are clear, external frameworks will be easy. It was built 3 years ago but I recently uploaded it to Git Hub. Enjoy!
Here is the demo link for the application. [Click Here](https://danebista.github.io/Dangerous-Dave-Game-PureVanillaJs/).
